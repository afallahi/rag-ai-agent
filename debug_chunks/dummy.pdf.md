Background
As part of an energy upgrade project, a leading 
chemical manufacturing company in Egypt partnered 
with Armstrong Fluid Technology and our local 
representative partner, Gabtic Engineering, to reduce 
power consumption at its production facility. The

--- Chunk 3 ---
primary goal was to minimize pump force during 
production cooling - an essential step in improving 
operational efficiency and cutting energy costs. 
The existing hvac system included oversized and 
outdated legacy pumps which contributed to 
reliability concerns and excess energy use. 
Understanding the goals to be achieved, Armstrong 
suggested replacing the existing system with 
intelligent Design Envelope pumps, supported by 
Pump Manager, a cloud-based performance tracking 
service.

service. 
Design Envelope is an intelligent, connected 
technology that tracks actual system conditions, 
and dynamically adjusts equipment operation. Pump 
Manager, a part of Armstrong’s Active Performance 
Managementtm suite, is a cloud-based service that 
leverages the intelligence of Design Envelope pumps, 
allowing operators and managers to actively manage 
the performance of an hvac system.
The upgrade leveraged Auto-Flow Balance 
technology to determine the actual system demand

technology to determine the actual system demand 
for flow. The new pumps also provide sensorless 
parallel operation and best-efficiency staging using 
the patented Parallel Sensorless Pump Control.
The project was completed without any 
disruption to system operations, demonstrating 
Armstrong’s commitment to minimizing down-
time and ensuring seamless transitions. This 
simple retrofit helped reduce the facility’s 
annual energy costs from $34,549 to $13,194,

annual energy costs from $34,549 to $13,194, 
a savings of over $21,355 per year, based on 
continuous operation (8,760 hours per year) 
and an electricity rate of $0.034 per kWh. In 
addition to improving system efficiency and 
reliability, the upgrade also reduced power 
consumption from a design condition of 
116 kW at design head to an actual building 
requirement of just 44.3 kW, measured after 
Auto-Flow Balancing. This project is a prime 
example of how advanced pump technology
